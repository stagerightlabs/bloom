Every attempt has been made to use a consistent nomenclature in this project.  Here is a glossary of terms:

Amount: A string representing a numerical ledger value as it would be displayed to a user. Stellar limits the largest numerical ledger value to be "922,337,203,685.4775807", which is the largest value that can also be represented by a 64 bit signed integer.  https://developers.stellar.org/docs/issuing-assets/anatomy-of-an-asset/#amount-precision

Integer: A class representing an integer value that may or may not exceed PHP's maximum allowed int value.

int: The traditional scalar integer type provided by PHP.
